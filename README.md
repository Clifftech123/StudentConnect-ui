# Student Connect - Frontend

This is the frontend repository for the Student Connect project. Student Connect is a web application designed to connect students and facilitate knowledge sharing among them. The goal of this project is to create a platform where students can collaborate, ask questions, and help each other in their educational journey.

## Features

- User Registration: Students can create an account on the platform to gain access to its features.
- User Authentication: Registered users can log in securely to their accounts.
- User Profile: Each user has a profile page where they can manage their personal information and customize their profile.
- Posts: Users can create posts to share their thoughts, ideas, and educational resources with the community.
- Comments: Users can comment on posts, providing feedback, additional information, or engaging in discussions.
- Post Interactions: Users can like, bookmark, and share posts to engage with the content and spread knowledge.
- Search: The platform includes a search functionality to help users find relevant posts and topics.
- Notifications: Users receive notifications for activities such as new comments, likes, or mentions.
- User Connections: Students can connect with each other, follow other users, and build their network.

## Tech Stack

The frontend of Student Connect is built using the following technologies:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language.
- **Redux**: A state management library for managing application state.
- **React Router**: A routing library for handling navigation and routing within the application.
- **Axios**: A library for making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A CSS-in-JS library for styling React components.

## Folder Structure

Here is an overview of the folder structure of the frontend codebase:
GitHub Copilot: Yes, there are several things you can do to make the README file look nicer. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Add some headings to break up the text and make it easier to read.
2. Use bullet points to list the features of the application.
3. Add some screenshots or images to show what the application looks like.
4. Use code blocks to highlight code snippets or configuration files.
5. Add a table of contents to make it easier to navigate the document.

Here is an example of how you could update the README file:

## Folder Structure

Here is an overview of the folder structure of the frontend codebase:

``` bash
src/
├── assets/
├── components/
├── pages/
├── services/
├── utils/
├── App.tsx
└── index.tsx
```

- `src/assets`: Contains static assets such as images, fonts, and stylesheets.
- `src/components`: Houses reusable UI components organized by domain or functionality.
- `src/pages`: Contains top-level components representing individual pages of the application.
- `src/services`: Handles interactions with the backend API and manages data related to different entities.
- `src/utils`: Contains utility functions and modules used throughout the application.
- `src/App.tsx`: The entry point component that handles routing and rendering of different pages and components.
- `src/index.tsx`: The main entry point of the application where the App component is rendered and mounted to the DOM.

## Getting Started
